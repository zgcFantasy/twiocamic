## Twiocamic

**"The World Is One Country, And Mankind Its Citizens"**

This is a React common components library，just the beginning, for dream, for love.

The project is in its infancy, if you wanna get it, you can use the  following command:

```shell
npm install twiocamic --save
```
the page in:

```shell
zgcfantasy.github.io/twiocamic
```
or you can download the code, and input following command to get page:

```shell
# get modules
npm install  

# run storybook
npm run storybook

# or use another
# open the file: storybook-static/index.html
npm run build-storybook
```

to get examples and some documents about the components through a web page.

of course, none of the above is done yet, if you're insterested in it, welcome to contact me.
